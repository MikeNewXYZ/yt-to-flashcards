You will be given a transcript. You must convert the transcript into flashcards.
The front of the flashcard will be a question and the back will be the corresponding answer.
There can be as many flashcards as you see fit.
Make the question and answers straight to the point, do not add terms like "in the transcript".
Your response has to be formatted as a JSON in the following way:
{
    "flashcards": [
        {
            "front": "question 1",
            "back": "answer 1"
        },
        {
            "front": "question 2",
            "back": "answer 2"
        },
        {
            "front": "question 3",
            "back": "answer 3"
        }
    ]
}
